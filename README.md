## Implementation Guide

### Prerequisites
Make sure to have an account on [Streamlabs](https://streamlabs.com/) and that your account is properly configured for live streaming.

### Step 1: Create the Simple Chatbox
Start by creating a basic HTML file for the chatbox. Include the basic HTML structure and add a div to display chat messages.

### Step 2: Add Styles with CSS
Create a `styles.css` file to style the chatbox according to your preferences. Adjust as needed.

### Step 3: Implement Logic with JavaScript
In the `script.js` file, add the JavaScript code to manage the display of messages in the chatbox. This is a basic example; you can expand and customize as needed.

### Step 4: Integrate with Streamlabs

1. Go to the Streamlabs dashboard and access the chatbox settings.
2. In the custom code field, insert the HTML code from Step 1.
3. Create custom styles in the custom CSS field.
4. In the custom JavaScript field, insert the code from Step 3.
5. Save the changes and test the chatbox during a live broadcast.
